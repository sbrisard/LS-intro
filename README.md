# An introduction to Lippmann–Schwinger solvers

This is the repository for the LaTeX source of the book “An introduction to
Lippmann–Schwinger solvers”.

Lippmann–Schwinger solvers (also known, quite awkwardly, as *FFT-based methods*)
are efficient, grid-based solvers for the homogenization of heterogeneous
materials. They were first introduced by Moulinec and Suquet in the
mid-90s. This book provides a brief overview of the method. It covers the
definition of Green operators and the Lippmann–Schwinger equation and their
discretization.
